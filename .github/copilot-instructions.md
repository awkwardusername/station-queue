This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript web app for queue management at stations. It includes three roles: User (queues up, no login, tracked by cookie), Person (manages a station, sees and pops queue, accesses via station-specific ID), and Administrator (creates stations, access via secret key). The backend will be implemented in the same project using a simple Node.js/Express server with in-memory data for queues and stations.
